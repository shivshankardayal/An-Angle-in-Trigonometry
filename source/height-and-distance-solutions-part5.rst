201. The diagram is given below:

        :align: center

     Let :math:`BC` be the tower having a height of :math:`h`. According to question :math:`AB = h` and :math:`BD = h/2`.

     In :math:`\triangle BCD, \tan\alpha = \frac{h}{\frac{h}{2}} = 2`

     In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan\beta = \frac{h}{h} \Rightarrow \alpha = 45^\circ`

     :math:`L\tan\alpha = 10 + \log 2 = 10.30103` (given)

     :math:`L\tan\alpha - L\tan63^\circ26'= 10.30103 - 10.30094`

     If the difference is :math:`x^2`, then :math:`x^2 = \frac{60\times306}{3152} = 5.81^2`

     :math:`\therefore \alpha = 63^\circ26'6''`

     Change in sun's altitude :math:`= 63^\circ26'6'' - 45^\circ = 18^\circ26'6''`

202. This problem is similar to :math:`117`, and has been left as an exercise.

203. Since the angle of elevation is same from every point it is clear that the balloon is above the
     circumcenter. From sine rule, :math:`\sin\beta = \frac{b}{2R} \Rightarrow R = \frac{b}{2\sin\beta}`.

     If :math:`h` is the height of the balloon then :math:`\tan\alpha = \frac{h}{R} \Rightarrow h =
     R\tan\alpha`

     :math:`= \frac{b}{2}\tan\alpha.\cosec\beta`

204. Consider the diagram is given below:

     .. image:: _static/images/28_204.webp
        :alt: 204th problem
        :align: center

     In the diagram :math:`A` representes the lighthouse. :math:`AB` is north-east direction and :math:`AC`
     is north-west direction between which the light is thrown by the lighthouse. Let :math:`BC` is the
     westward path of the steamer. Given that the distance of steamer is :math:`5` k m from lighthouse
     i.e. :math:`AB = 5` km and clearly :math:`\triangle ABC` is a isosceles, right angled triangle so
     :math:`AC = 5` km and :math:`BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 5^2} = 5\sqrt{2}` km.

     Speed of steamer :math:`= \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{30\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{6}` km/min.
