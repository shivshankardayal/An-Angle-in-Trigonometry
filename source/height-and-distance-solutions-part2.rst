   Let :math:`AB` be the lamp post having height :math:`h` m, and :math:`BD` be the girl having height :math:`1.6` m. The distance
   of the grl from the lamp post is :math:`AC = 3.2` m. :math:`CE` is the langeth of the shadow given as :math:`4.8` m. In the
   :math:`\triangle ABE` and :math:`\triangle CDE, \angle E` is common, :math:`\angle A = \angle C = 90^\circ` so third angle will
   be also equal. This makes the triangles similar.

   :math:`\therefore \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AE}{CE} \Rightarrow h = \frac{8}{3}` m.

52. The diagram is given below:

      :align: center

   Let :math:`AC` be the building having a height of :math:`30` m. Let :math:`E` and :math:`G` point of observations where angles
   of elevation are :math:`60^\circ` and :math:`30^\circ` respectively. Let :math:`AEF` be the line of foot of the building and
   foot of the observer which is a horizontal line. Let :math:`DE` and :math:`FE` are the heights of the
   observer. Draw :math:`BEG\parallel ADF` so that :math:`AB = DE = FG = 1.5` m. Thus, :math:`BC = 28.5` m. We have to find
   :math:`DF = EG`.

   In :math:`\triangle BCE, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{BC}{CE} \Rightarrow CE = \frac{28.5}{\sqrt{3}}` m.

   In :math:`\triangle BCG, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BC}{CG} \Rightarrow CG = 28.5\sqrt{3}` m.

   Thus, :math:`DF = EG = CG - CF = \frac{57}{\sqrt{3}}` m, which is the distance walked by the observer.

53. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 53rd problem
      :align: center

   Let the height of the tower :math:`AB` is :math:`h` m. When the altitude of the sun is :math:`60^\circ` let the length of the
   shadown be :math:`AC = x` m. Then according to question length of shadow when the sun's altitude i :math:`30^\circ` the length
   of shadow will be :math:`AD, 40` m longer i.e. :math:`AD = x + 40`.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{3}h` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{h}{x + 40} \Rightarrow x = 20` m and :math:`h
   = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

54. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 54th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the building with :math:`20` m height. Let the height of tower be :math:`h` m represented by :math:`BC` in the
   figure. Let :math:`D` be the point of observation at a distance :math:`x` from the foot of the building :math:`AB`.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{20}{x} \Rightarrow x = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{h + 20}{x}\Rightarrow h = 40` m.

55. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 55th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`DE` be the building having a height of :math:`8` m. Let :math:`AC` be the multistoried building having height
   :math:`h + 8` m. Foot of both the buildings are joined on horizontal plane i.e. :math:`AD`. Draw a line parallel to :math:`AD`
   which is :math:`BE`. So :math:`BE` is equal to :math:`AD` which we have let as :math:`x` m. Clearly, :math:`AB = 8` m. Let
   height of :math:`BC` to be :math:`h` m.

   In :math:`\triangle CBE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BC}{BE} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow \sqrt{3}h = x`.

   In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{h + 8}{x}\Rightarrow h =
   \frac{8}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \Rightarrow h + 8 = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}` m.

56. The diagram is given below:

      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the pedestal having height :math:`h` m and :math:`BC` be the statue having height :math:`1.6` m on top of
   pedestal. Let :math:`D` be the point of observation from where the angles of elevation as given in the question are
   :math:`45^\circ` and :math:`60^\circ`.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow h = x`.

   In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AC}{CD} = \frac{h + 1.6}{x} \Rightarrow h = \frac{1.6}{\sqrt{3} -
   1}` m.

57. This problem is similar to 55 and has been left as an exercise.

58. The diagram is given below:

      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the tower having height :math:`75` m. Let :math:`C` and :math:`D` be the position of two ships and angles of
   elevation are as given in the question. Let foor of the tower be in line with ships such that :math:`AC = x` m and distance
   between the ships as :math:`d` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{75}{x} \Rightarrow x = 75` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{75}{x + d} \Rightarrow d = 75(\sqrt{3} - 1)` m.

59. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 59th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the building and :math:`CD` be thw tower having height :math:`50` m. The angles of elevation are shown as
   given in the question. Let distance between the foot of the tower and the building be :math:`d` m and height of the building be
   :math:`h` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{d} \Rightarrow d = \sqrt{3}h`.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{50}{d} \Rightarrow 3h = 50 \Rightarrow h = \frac{50}{3}` m.

60. The diagram is given below:

      :align: center

   Let :math:`DE` represent the banks of river and :math:`BC` the  bridge. Given that height of the bridge is
   :math:`30` m. :math:`\therefore BD = CE = 30` m. The angles of depression from point :math:`A` is shown as given in the
   question. We have to find :math:`DE = BC` i.e. width of the river.

   In :math:`\triangle ACE, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{CE}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = 30` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BD}{AB} \Rightarrow AB = 30\sqrt{3}` m.

   Thus, width of river :math:`= 30 + 30\sqrt{3} = 30(\sqrt{3} + 1)` m
