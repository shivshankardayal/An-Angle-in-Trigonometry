   Let :math:`AB` be the lamp post having height :math:`h` m, and :math:`BD` be the girl having height :math:`1.6` m. The distance
   of the grl from the lamp post is :math:`AC = 3.2` m. :math:`CE` is the langeth of the shadow given as :math:`4.8` m. In the
   :math:`\triangle ABE` and :math:`\triangle CDE, \angle E` is common, :math:`\angle A = \angle C = 90^\circ` so third angle will
   be also equal. This makes the triangles similar.

   :math:`\therefore \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AE}{CE} \Rightarrow h = \frac{8}{3}` m.
