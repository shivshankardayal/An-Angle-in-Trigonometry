    Let :math:`AB` be the lamp post having height :math:`h` m, and :math:`BD` be the girl having height :math:`1.6` m. The distance
    of the grl from the lamp post is :math:`AC = 3.2` m. :math:`CE` is the langeth of the shadow given as :math:`4.8` m. In the
    :math:`\triangle ABE` and :math:`\triangle CDE, \angle E` is common, :math:`\angle A = \angle C = 90^\circ` so third angle will
    be also equal. This makes the triangles similar.

    :math:`\therefore \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AE}{CE} \Rightarrow h = \frac{8}{3}` m.

    Let :math:`AC` be the building having a height of :math:`30` m. Let :math:`E` and :math:`G` point of observations where angles
    of elevation are :math:`60^\circ` and :math:`30^\circ` respectively. Let :math:`AEF` be the line of foot of the building and
    foot of the observer which is a horizontal line. Let :math:`DE` and :math:`FE` are the heights of the
    observer. Draw :math:`BEG\parallel ADF` so that :math:`AB = DE = FG = 1.5` m. Thus, :math:`BC = 28.5` m. We have to find
    :math:`DF = EG`.

    In :math:`\triangle BCE, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{BC}{CE} \Rightarrow CE = \frac{28.5}{\sqrt{3}}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle BCG, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BC}{CG} \Rightarrow CG = 28.5\sqrt{3}` m.

    Thus, :math:`DF = EG = CG - CF = \frac{57}{\sqrt{3}}` m, which is the distance walked by the observer.

    Let the height of the tower :math:`AB` is :math:`h` m. When the altitude of the sun is :math:`60^\circ` let the length of the

    of shadow will be :math:`AD, 40` m longer i.e. :math:`AD = x + 40`.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{3}h` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{h}{x + 40} \Rightarrow x = 20` m and :math:`h
    = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{20}{x} \Rightarrow x = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{h + 20}{x}\Rightarrow h = 40` m.

    which is :math:`BE`. So :math:`BE` is equal to :math:`AD` which we have let as :math:`x` m. Clearly, :math:`AB = 8` m. Let
    height of :math:`BC` to be :math:`h` m.

    In :math:`\triangle CBE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BC}{BE} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow \sqrt{3}h = x`.

    In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{h + 8}{x}\Rightarrow h =
    \frac{8}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \Rightarrow h + 8 = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow h = x`.

    In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AC}{CD} = \frac{h + 1.6}{x} \Rightarrow h = \frac{1.6}{\sqrt{3} -

    between the ships as :math:`d` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{75}{x} \Rightarrow x = 75` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{75}{x + d} \Rightarrow d = 75(\sqrt{3} - 1)` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{d} \Rightarrow d = \sqrt{3}h`.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{50}{d} \Rightarrow 3h = 50 \Rightarrow h = \frac{50}{3}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ACE, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{CE}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = 30` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BD}{AB} \Rightarrow AB = 30\sqrt{3}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{DE}{AD} = \frac{h}{80 - x} \Rightarrow 3x = 80 -x
    \Rightarrow x = 20` m. :math:`\Rightarrow h = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

    Clearly, :math:`AB = DJ = y` m(say) and :math:`AC = EJ = x` m(say).

    In :math:`\triangle AEJ, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AJ}{EJ} \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{\sqrt{3}}` m.

    Similarly, :math:`y = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

    depression are given as :math:`60^\circ` and :math:`30^\circ` which are shown as angles of elevation at these points.

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = h/\sqrt{3}`

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AD} \Rightarrow AD = h\sqrt{3}`

    :math:`CD = AD - AC = 2h/\sqrt{3}`

    The car covers the distance :math:`CD` in six seconds. Thus speed of the car if :math:`2h/(6\sqrt{3}) = h/3\sqrt{3}`

    Time taken to cover :math:`AC` to reach the foot of the tower is :math:`\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}\times\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{h} = 3`

    In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC}\Rightarrow AC = h/\sqrt{3}` m.

    In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan45^\circ = h = \frac{AB}{AD}\Rightarrow AD = h` m.

    Since :math:`AD < AD` so the fire station at :math:`C` will reach the building faster.

               :math:`AD = AC + CD \Rightarrow h = h/\sqrt{3} + 20000 \Rightarrow h = \frac{20000\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}`

     Let :math:`AB` be the deck of the ship with given height of :math:`10` m. Let :math:`CE` be the cliff with base at
     :math:`C`. Let the height of portion :math:`DE` be :math:`x` m. The angles of elevation of the top and of the bottom of the
     cliff are shown as given in the question.

     In :math:`\triangle BDE, \tan45^\circ = DE/BD \Rightarrow BD = x` m.

     In :math:`\triangle, \tan30^circ = CD/BD \Rightarrow BD = 10\sqrt{3} = x`

     Thus, :math:`CE = 10 + 10\sqrt{3} = 27.32` m.

     So height of the cliff is :math:`27.32` m and distance of cliff from the ship is :math:`10` m.
