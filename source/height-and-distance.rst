Height and Distance
*******************
There are problems where distances between two points are not directly measurable or difficult. Most of such problems can be solved
by applying trigonometric ratios with ease. This chapter is dependent on application of what we have studied so far about
trigonometric ratios.

1. **Angle of Elevation:**

   Let :math:`O` and :math:`P` be two points, where :math:`P` is at a higher level than :math:`O`. Also let :math:`O` be the
   position of observer and :math:``
