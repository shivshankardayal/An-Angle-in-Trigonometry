Height and Distance
*******************
There are problems where distances between two points are not directly measurable or difficult. Most of such problems can be solved
by applying trigonometric ratios with ease. This chapter is dependent on application of what we have studied so far about
trigonometric ratios.

1. **Angle of Elevation:**

   Let :math:`O` and :math:`P` be two points, where :math:`P` is at a higher level than :math:`O`. Also let :math:`O` be the
   position of observer and :math:`P` the position of the object. Draw a horizontal line  :math:`OM` through the point
   :math:`O`. :math:`OP` is called the line of observation or line of sight. Then :math:`\angle POM = \theta` is called the angle
   of elevation of :math:`P` as observed from :math:`O`.

2. **Angle of Depression**

   In the above example, if :math:`P` be at a lower level than :math:`O`, then :math:`\angle MOP = \theta` is called the angle of
   depression.

3. **Bearing**

   In the above example, if the observer and the object i.e. :math:`O` and :math:`P` be on the same level then bearing is
   defined. Four standard directions; East, West, North and South are taken as cardinal directions for measuring bearing. If
   :math:`\angle POE = \theta` is the bearing of point :math:`P` with respect to :math:`O` measured from East to North.
