      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the tower, :math:`A` the point of observation and :math:`\theta` as angle of elevation.

   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan\theta = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{100\sqrt{3}}{100} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow \theta = 60^\circ`.

2. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 2nd problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the tower, :math:`A` the point of observation and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 30.\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}` m.

3. The diagram is given below:

      :alt: 3rd problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{60.2}{\sqrt{3}} = 40\sqrt{3}` m.

4. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_4.png
      :alt: 4th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 100\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}= 50\sqrt{3}` m.

5. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_5.png
      :alt: 5th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the pole, :math:`A` the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{12}{\sin30^\circ} = 24` m.

   Thus, the acrobat has to climb :math:`24` m.
