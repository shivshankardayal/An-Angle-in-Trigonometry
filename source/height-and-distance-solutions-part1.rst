   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan\theta = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{100\sqrt{3}}{100} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow \theta = 60^\circ`.

   Let :math:`BC` be the tower, :math:`A` the point of observation and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 30.\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}` m.

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{60.2}{\sqrt{3}} = 40\sqrt{3}` m.

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 100\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}= 50\sqrt{3}` m.

   Let :math:`BC` be the pole, :math:`A` the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{12}{\sin30^\circ} = 24` m.

   Thus, the acrobat has to climb :math:`24` m.

      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the pole, :math:`A` the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 20.\frac{1}{2} = 10` m.

7. The diagram is given below:

   :math:`45^\circ` with the bank. Let :math:`BC` represent the width of river, which clearly makes a right angle triangle with
   right angle at :math:`C`.

   Clearly, :math:`\sin45^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 150.\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 75\sqrt{2}` m.

   Thus, width of the river is :math:`74\sqrt{2}` meters.

8. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_8.png
      :alt: 8th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the observer, :math:`1.5` m tall. :math:`CE` be the tower. Draw line :math:`BD` parallel to :math:`AC` which
   will make :math:`CD = 1.5` m. In right angle triangle :math:`BDE` angle of elevation :math:`\angle B = 45^\circ`. Given,
   :math:`BD = 28.5` m. Thus,

   :math:`\tan45^\circ = \frac{DE}{BD} \Rightarrow DE = 28.5` m. :math:`\therefore CE = CD + DE = 1.5 + 28.5 = 30` m.

9. The diagram is given below:

   :math:`BD` is the pole and :math:`AC` is the ladder. :math:`C` is the point which the electrician need to reach to repair the
   pole which is :math:`1.3` m below the top of the pole. Total height of the pole is :math:`4` m, thus, :math:`BC = 4 - 1.3 =
   2.7` m.

   We are given than ladder makes an angle of :math:`60^\circ` with the horizontal.

   :math:`\therefore \sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{BC}{\sin60^\circ} = \frac{2.7\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3.12` m.

   :math:`A` is the point of observation. :math:`B` is the foot of the tower and :math:`C` is the top of the tower. :math:`CD` is
   the height of the water tank above the tower. Given :math:`AB = 40` m .

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = AB.\tan30^\circ = \frac{40}{\sqrt{3}} = 23.1` m,
   which is height of the toweer.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan45\circ = \frac{BD}{AB} \Rightarrow BD = AB.\tan45^\circ = 40.1 = 40` m which is combined height
   of the tower and water tank. Thus, height or depth of the water tank :math:`= CD = BD - BC = 40 - 23.1 = 16.9` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ACD, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{CD}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = 15` m. Thus, :math:`ED` is also :math:`15` m because
   :math:`ED` is paralle to :math:`AC`.

   In :math:`\triangle BED, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BE}{ED} \Rightarrow BE = 5\sqrt{3}` m.

   The angles of depression are given which would be same as angle of elevation from top and bottom of tower.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{60}{x} \Rightarrow x = 20\sqrt{3}` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ADE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BE}{x}\Rightarrow BE = 20` m.

   :math:`\therefore` Height of the building :math:`CD = AE = AB - BE = 60 - 20 = 40` m.

   In :math:`\triangle BDC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{BE}{x} \Rightarrow BE = 30` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{3600\sqrt{3}}{x} \Rightarrow x = 3600` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ADE, \tan40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3600\sqrt{3}}{x + y} \Rightarrow y = 7200` m.
