   Let :math:`BC` be the tower, :math:`A` the point of observation and :math:`\theta` as angle of elevation.

   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan\theta = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{100\sqrt{3}}{100} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow \theta = 60^\circ`.

      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the tower, :math:`A` the point of observation and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 30.\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}` m.

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{60.2}{\sqrt{3}} = 40\sqrt{3}` m.

      :alt: 4th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the height of kite, :math:`AC` be the length of string the angle of elevation is :math:`60^\circ`.

   Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 100\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}= 50\sqrt{3}` m.

5. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_5.png
      :alt: 5th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the pole, :math:`A` the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{12}{\sin30^\circ} = 24` m.

   Thus, the acrobat has to climb :math:`24` m.

      :align: center

   Let :math:`BC` be the pole, :math:`A` the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is :math:`30^\circ`.

   Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at :math:`B`. Thus,

   :math:`\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 20.\frac{1}{2} = 10` m.

7. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_7.png
      :alt: 7th problem
      :align: center

   Let the shaded region represent the river and vertical lines the banks. :math:`AB` represents the bridge, making an angle of
   :math:`45^\circ` with the bank. Let :math:`BC` represent the width of river, which clearly makes a right angle triangle with
   right angle at :math:`C`.

   Clearly, :math:`\sin45^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 150.\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 75\sqrt{2}` m.

   Thus, width of the river is :math:`74\sqrt{2}` meters.

8. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_8.png
      :alt: 8th problem
      :align: center

   Let :math:`AB` be the observer, :math:`1.5` m tall. :math:`CE` be the tower. Draw line :math:`BD` parallel to :math:`AC` which
   will make :math:`CD = 1.5` m. In right angle triangle :math:`BDE` angle of elevation :math:`\angle B = 45^\circ`. Given,
   :math:`BD = 28.5` m. Thus,

   :math:`\tan45^\circ = \frac{DE}{BD} \Rightarrow DE = 28.5` m. :math:`\therefore CE = CD + DE = 1.5 + 28.5 = 30` m.

9. The diagram is given below:

   .. image:: _static/images/28_9.png
      :alt: 9th problem
      :align: center

   :math:`BD` is the pole and :math:`AC` is the ladder. :math:`C` is the point which the electrician need to reach to repair the
   pole which is :math:`1.3` m below the top of the pole. Total height of the pole is :math:`4` m, thus, :math:`BC = 4 - 1.3 =
   2.7` m.

   We are given than ladder makes an angle of :math:`60^\circ` with the horizontal.

   :math:`\therefore \sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{BC}{\sin60^\circ} = \frac{2.7\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3.12` m.

      :align: center

   :math:`A` is the point of observation. :math:`B` is the foot of the tower and :math:`C` is the top of the tower. :math:`CD` is
   the height of the water tank above the tower. Given :math:`AB = 40` m .

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = AB.\tan30^\circ = \frac{40}{\sqrt{3}} = 23.1` m,
   which is height of the toweer.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan45\circ = \frac{BD}{AB} \Rightarrow BD = AB.\tan45^\circ = 40.1 = 40` m which is combined height
   of the tower and water tank. Thus, height or depth of the water tank :math:`= CD = BD - BC = 40 - 23.1 = 16.9` m.

   point of observation. Given, :math:`CD = 20` m. Let :math:`AB = h` m and :math:`AC = x` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x`

   In :math:`\triangle ABD \tan30^\circ = \frac{h}{x + 20}\Rightarrow \sqrt{3}h = x + 20`

   :math:`\Rightarrow 3x = x + 20 \Rightarrow x = 10` m. :math:`\Rightarrow h = 10\sqrt{3}` m.

   :math:`60^\circ` with remaining portion of tree standing. If :math:`AB = x` m, then :math:`BD = 12 - x` because original height
   of the tree is given as :math:`12` m.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \sin60^\circ = \frac{x}{12 - x} \Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{x}{12 - x} \Rightarrow x = 5.57`

      :align: center

   :math:`AC` is the tree before breaking. Portion :math:`BC` has borken and has become :math:`BD` which makes an angle of
   :math:`30^\circ` with remaining portion of tree standing. If :math:`AB = x` m, then :math:`BD = l - x` where :math:`l` is the
   original height of the tree.

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \sin30^\circ = \frac{x}{l - x} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 3x = l`

   :math:`\cos30^\circ = \frac{30}{l - x} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow x = 17.32 \Rightarrow l = 51.96` m.

   the distance of :math:`C` from the foot of the tower i.e. :math:`A`.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan\beta = \frac{3}{4} = \frac{h}{x}`

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan\alpha = \frac{5}{12} = \frac{h}{x + 192} \Rightarrow h = 180` meters.

   point of observation from foot of the tower. Given :math:`CD = 10` meters.

   In :math:`\triangle ABC, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{h}{x}\Rightarrow x = h`

   In :math:`\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{x + 10}\Rightarrow h = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} = 13.66`
