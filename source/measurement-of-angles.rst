Measurement of Angles
*********************
The word trignometry comes from Greek(τριγωνομετρία) which includes two words;
τριγωνο meaning triangle and μέτρηση which means measurement.
The objective of studying plane trigonometry is to develop a method of solving
plane triangles. However, as time changes everything it has changed the scope
of trigonometry to include polygons and circles as well. A lot of concepts in
this book will come from your geometry classes in lower classes. It is a
good idea to review the concepts which you have studied till now without which
you are going to struggle while studying trigonometry in this book.

Angle in Geometry
=================
If we consider a line extending to infinity in both directions, and a point
:math:`O` which divides this line in two parts one on each side of the point
then each part is called a *ray* or *half-line*. Thus :math:`O` divides the
line into two rays :math:`OA` and :math:`OA'`.

The point :math:`O` is called vertex or origin for these days. An angle is a
figure formed by two rays or half lies meeting at a common vertex. These half
lines are called sides of the angle.

An angle is denoted by the symbol :math:`\angle` followed by three capital
letters of which the middle one represents the vertex and remaining two opint
as you can guess point to two sides. Otherwise the angle is simply written as
one letter representing the vertex of the angle.

The angle in above image is written as :math:`\angle AOB` or :math:`\angle BOA`
or :math:`\angle O.`

Each angle can be measured and there are different units for the
measurement. In geometry, an angle always lie between :math:`0^{\circ}` and
:math:`360^{\circ}` and negative angles are meaningless. Measure of an angle is
the smallest amount of rotation from the direction of one ray of
the angle to the direction of the other.

Angle in Trigonometry
=====================
Angles are more generalized in trigonometry. They can have positive or negative
values. As was the case in gerometry, similarly angles are measured in
trigonometry. The starting and ending positions of revolving rays are
called initial side and terminal side respectively. The revolving half line is
called the generating line or the radius vector. For example, if :math:`OA` and
:math:`OB` are the initial and final position of the radius vector then angle
formed will be :math:`\angle AOB.`

Angles Exceeding :math:`360^{\circ}`
------------------------------------
In Geometry, angles are limited to :math:`0^{\circ}` to :math:`360^{\circ}.` However, when multiple revolutions are involved angles
are more than 360°. For example, the revolving line starts from the initial position and makes :math:`n` complete revolutions in
anticlockwise direction and also further angle α in the same direction. We then have a certain angle :math:`\beta_n` given by
:math:`\beta_n = x\times 260^{\circ} + \alpha` where :math:`0^{\circ} \leq \alpha \leq 360^{\circ}` and :math:`n` is zero or
positive integer. Thus, there are infinite possible angles.

Sign of Angles
--------------
Angles formed by anticlockwise rotation of the radius vector are taken as positive and angles formed by clockwise rotation of the
radius vector are taken as negative.

Quadrants
=========
.. image:: _static/images/1_4_quadrants.png
   :alt: quadrants
   :align: center

Let :math:`XOX'` and :math:`YOY'` be two mutually perpendicular lines in a plane and :math:`OX` be the initial half line. The lines
divide the whole reason in quadrants. :math:`XOY, YOX', X'OY'` and :math:`Y'OX` are respectively called 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th
quadrants. According to terminal side lying in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quadrants the angles are said to be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th
quadrants respectively. A *quandrant angle* is an angle formed if terminal side coincides with one of the axes.

For any angle :math:`\alpha` which is not a quadrant angle and when number of revolutions is zero and radius vector rotates in
anticlockwise directions:

* :math:`0^{\circ}  < \alpha < 90^{\circ}` if :math:`\alpha` lies in first quadrant

* :math:`90^{\circ}  < \alpha < 180^{\circ}` if :math:`\alpha` lies in second quadrant

* :math:`180^{\circ}  < \alpha < 270^{\circ}` if :math:`\alpha` lies in third quadrant

* :math:`270^{\circ}  < \alpha < 360^{\circ}` if :math:`\alpha` lies in fourth quadrant

* when terminal side lies on :math:`OY`, angle formed :math:`= 90^{\circ}`

* when terminal side lies on :math:`OX'`, angle formed :math:`= 180^{\circ}`

* when terminal side lies on :math:`OY'`, angle formed :math:`= 270^{\circ}`

* when terminal side lies on :math:`OX`, angle formed :math:`= 360^{\circ}`

Units of Measurement
====================
In Geometry, angles are usually measured in terms of right angles, however, that is an inconvenient system for smaller angles. So
we introduce different systems of measurements. There are three system of units for this:

1. Sexagecimal or British system: In British system, a right angle is divided into :math:`90` equal parts called *degrees*. Each degree is then divided into
   :math:`60` equal parts called minutes and each minute is further is divided into :math:`60` parts called seconds.

   A degree, a minute and a second are denoted by :math:`1^{\circ},1''` and :math:`1'` respectively. 

2. Centesimal or French System: In French system, a right angle is divided into :math:`100` equal parts called *grades*. Each grade
   is then divided into :math:`100` equal parts called *minutes* and each minute is further is divided into :math:`100` parts
   called *seconds*.

   A degree, a minute and a second are denoted by :math:`1^g,1''` and :math:`1'` respectively. 

3. Radian or Circular Measure: An arc equal to radius of a circle when subtends an anngle on the center then that angle is
   :math:`1` radian and is denoted by :math:`1^c`. The angle made by half of perimeter is :math:`\pi` radians. Also, from Geometry
   we know that angle subtended is the ratio between length of cord and radius. This ratio is in radians. Since both length or
   chord and radius have same unit radian is a constant.

Relationship between Systems of Measurements
--------------------------------------------
If measure of an angle if :math:`D` degrees, :math:`G` grades and :math:`C` radians then upon elementary manipulation we find that
:math:`\frac{D}{180} = \frac{G}{200} = \frac{C}{\pi}`

Meaning of :math:`\pi`
----------------------
The ratio of circumference and diameter of a circle is always constant and this constant is denoted by gree letter :math:`\pi`.

:math:`\pi` is an irrational number. In general, we use the value of :math:`\frac{22}{7}` but :math:`\frac{355}{113}` is more
accurate though not exact. If :math:`r` be the radius of a circle and :math:`c` be the circumference then :math:`\frac{c}{2r}
= \pi` leading circumference to be :math:`c=2\pi r.`
