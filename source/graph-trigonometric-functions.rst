Graph of Trigonometric Functions
********************************
Graphs of functions give us idea about the nature of functions. As you must have drawn graphs of algebraic
functions or linear equations similarly we draw the graph of trigonometric functions. One of the advantages
of plotting graphs of trigonometric functions is that we can find values of artbitrary angles using the
graph; while it is possible to calculate such values using the function definitions for algebraic functions
it is much harder to do the same for trigionometric functions.

21. We have to find number of solutions for :math:`\tan x = x + 1` for :math:`-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq
    2\pi`. So we plot both :math:`y = \tan x` and :math:`y = x + 1` and no. of  intersections will be no. of
    solutions.

    .. image:: _static/images/34_21.webp
       :alt: Plot of tan x and x + 1
       :align: center

    As we can see that there are two points of intersections so there will be two solutions of the given
    equation in the given range of :math:`x`.

22. Given equation is :math:`x + 2\tan x = \frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow \tan x = \frac{\pi}{4} -
    \frac{x}{2}`. So we plot for :math:`y = \tan x` and :math:`y = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{x}{2}` in the range
    of :math:`[0, 2\pi]`.

    .. image:: _static/images/34_22.webp

    As we can see that there are three points of intersections so there will be three solutions of the given
    equation in the given range of :math:`x`.

23. Given equation is :math:`\sin x = \frac{x}{100}`. Let :math:`y = \sin x = \frac{x}{100}`. When :math:`x
    = 0, y = 0` and when :math:`x = 1, y = 0.01`.

    :math:`\because -1\leq \sin x\leq 1 \Rightarrow -1\leq \frac{x}{100}\leq 1 \Rightarrow -100\leq x\leq
    100`

    :math:`\Rightarrow -31.8\pi\leq x\leq 31.8x` (approx.). Hence, the interval for :math:`x` will be

    .. image:: _static/images/34_26.webp
       :alt: Plot of tan x and x + 1/2
