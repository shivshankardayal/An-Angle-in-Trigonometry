Trigonometrical Equation
========================
An equation involving one or more trigonometrical ratios of unknown angle is called trigonometrical equation.

Ex. :math:`\cos^2x - 4\sin x = 1`

A trigonometrical identity is satisfied for every value of the unknown angle where as trigonometrical equation is satisfied for
only some values of unknown angle.
